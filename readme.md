# FreeMe Social
This is a social network task.

## Using FreeMe Social
Go to  [our site](http://freemesocial.herokuapp.com/) and register or login. Once signed in you can upload photo's and videos and set restrictions (Public, Friends only, Family only or Friends & Family) on who can view your photos. You can add other members as your friends or family or both.
Note: If a user adds you to their friends or family you will be able to see posts that they restrict to friends or familie but they won't see your own restricted posts, you will have to add them as your friends or family for that to happen.

## Finding other users
To see and add other members follow the [users](http://freemesocial.herokuapp.com/user/search-users) at the top right of the navigation bar to view users.

## Archiving & Deleting
You can archive or delete posts and unarchive or take out posts from trash. Posts can be archived or deleted anywhere on the website but can only be retrieved from your profile.
